# Step 4: Setup a Continuous Integration configuration
- What is the .circleci/config.yml doing?
Circleci/config.yml are configurartions that interacts with other code and runs builds, tests, security scans, approval steps, deployment. The config.yml file in this lab is running the job build-and-test that installs npm and then after this is complete, runs npm
- What do the various sections on the config file do?
The job section contains the collection of children. The steps section is the list of run directives. The name attribute provides useful info when returning warnings, errors, outputs. The command is a list of shell commands. The workflow or requires attriubute tells if a job requires another job to be completeted before continuing with that job.
- When a CI build is successful, what does that philosophically and practically/precisely indicate about the build?
When a CI build is successful, everyone in the process are able to push their code to the repo and be able to detect any bad builds and fix them quickly.
- If you were to take the next step and ready this project for Continuous Delivery, what additional changes might you make in this configuration (conceptual, not code)?
