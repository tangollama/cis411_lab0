# Step 4: Setup a Continuous Integration configuration
- What is the .circleci/config.yml doing?
> The config.yml seems to be configuring parts of the project and its directories. After that it seems to through a series of steps to finish configuration of the project. They are commands similar to if I was typing thigs into the terminal. The commands seem to do things like update caches and run tests.

- What do the various sections on the config file do?
> The docker section seems to be in charge of creating an image of the workspace and backing it up to circleci. It then sets a working directory

- When a CI build is successful, what does that philosophically and practically/precisely indicate about the build?
> For the CI build to be successful it has to pass certain tests. When it passes, it indicates that the build has merged successfully with a master branch and the software can be deployed. 

- If you were to take the next step and ready this project for Continuous Delivery, what additional changes might you make in this configuration (conceptual, not code)?
> For this to go into continuous deployment you would need to add commands to the file that deployed your branch to a server when you were done making changes.
