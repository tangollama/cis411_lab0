# Step 4: Setup a Continuous Integration configuration
- What is the .circleci/config.yml doing?
It sets up the project so that it can autmatically build the project whenever there is a push. 
- What do the various sections on the config file do?
The docker part is responible for deciding which version of setting to use for the build. Steps runs the test to make sure that the build integrated 
correctly and that the build doesn't fall. 
- When a CI build is successful, what does that philosophically and practically/precisely indicate about the build?
It means that the build actually works and that the integration was succesfull.
- If you were to take the next step and ready this project for Continuous Delivery, what additional changes might you make in this configuration (conceptual, not code)?
You would need to add a place for the deployment to be hosted(server) and a lot more tests to make sure it was deployment ready.
