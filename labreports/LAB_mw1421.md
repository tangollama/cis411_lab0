Instructors: [Joel Worrall](https://github.com/tangollama) & [Trevor Bunch](https://github.com/trevordbunch)<br>

# Step 1: Fork this repository
- The URL of my forked repository
    https://github.com/mw1421/cis411_lab0.git
- [The accompanying diagram of what my fork precisely and conceptually represents](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1Bzt8FWsGmBR3BQx8DZTcdofMr4r-zwmvKyvC2-N595A/edit?usp=sharing)
    tangollama's repository is like the master of the master branches in the project. 
    It is the originator of the projects, so everyone can pull from that repository,
    but not every fork can communicate with each other. Say Caleb Weaver also forked
    from tangollama's repo. He can merge back to the master of the masters, but he 
    could not merge with my branch. You can only go to the original repository. 
# Step 2: Clone your forked repository from the command line
- My GraphQL response from adding myself as an account on the test project
{
  "data": {
    "mutateAccount": {
      "id": "3f40e472-f517-4147-a8fb-1ddaf4ac7576",
      "name": "Michael Williams",
      "email": "mw1421@messiah.edu"
    }
  }
}

    - I made some mistakes, but I fixed my probelms and did it right the second time. 
    
- [The accompanying diagram of what my feature branch precisely and conceptually represents]((https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1Bzt8FWsGmBR3BQx8DZTcdofMr4r-zwmvKyvC2-N595A/edit?usp=sharing)

# Step 4: Setup a Continuous Integration configuration
- What is the .circleci/config.yml doing?
    Runs the command Greeting and the command Print the Current Time. 
- What do the various sections on the config file do?
    .circleci config file checks the version of circleci. Then it tries to find an image. It then moves to a different branch. It then runs the command “Greeting” where the command echoes “Hello, world.” It runs another command “Print the Current Time” where it prints the current date. It then builds the project. 
- When a CI build is successful, what does that philosophically and practically/precisely indicate about the build?
    It means that it is built, tested, and deployed easier and quicker on a lot of different platforms. 
- If you were to take the next step and ready this project for Continuous Delivery, what additional changes might you make in this configuration (conceptual, not code)?
    Building something to automate tests to detect problems, and then automatically push the products.

# Step 7: [EXTRA CREDIT] Augment the core project
PR reference in the report to one of the following:
1. Add one or more unit tests to the core assignment project. 
2. Configure the CircleCI config.yml to automatically build a Docker image of the project.
3. Configure an automatic deployment of the successful CircleCI build to an Amazon EC2 instance.
*************************************************************************************88
Something strange happened. I explained in the last commit message, but I did not push my latest results for the PR, so when I did git bash crashed and caused me some errors, so I uploaded this file separately outside of Git Bash.
