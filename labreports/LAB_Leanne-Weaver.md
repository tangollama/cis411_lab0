# Step 1: Fork this repository
- The URL of my forked repository
	https://github.com/Leanne-Weaver/cis411_lab0
- The accompanying diagram of what my fork precisely and conceptually represents. 
(Additional branches, develop and feature_1, were used to demonstrate the difference between a fork and a merge, 
as well as the difference between a merge and a pull request.)

# Step 4: Setup a Continuous Integration configuration
- What is the .circleci/config.yml doing?<br/>

This is a YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) file that identifies how the testing environment will be set up, along with the kind of tests that will be run.<br/>

- What do the various sections on the config file do?<br/>

The ```version``` portion specifies which version of CircleCI will be used.
The ```jobs``` portion contains instructions for jobs that CircleCI might execute.
The ```build``` is one of the jobs. In ```docker```, a Docker image is specified, which will be the job's primary container for when CircleCI launches a virtual environment.
The portion ```steps``` specifies the actions to be taken within the job ```build```.
The first of the ```steps``` to be taken is that CircleCI will ```checkout``` of the GitHub repository and clone it into the virtual environment it launched.
Next, with ```restore_cache``` with the given ```keys```, CircleCI restores dependencies. (This will help when we run yarn install, where only new dependencies will need to be downloaded.)
Then CircleCI runs the command ```yarn install```, which installs Yarn, a packaged dependency manager.
Afterwards, CircleCI will save the data in the cache to update it.
Finally, ```yarn test``` is ran by CircleCI to ensure that it was installed successfully.
The ```workflows``` is a set of rules for defining a collection of jobs and their execution order.

I used CircleCI documentation, [Adding a YML File](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/getting-started/#adding-a-yml-file), [Workflows Overview](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/workflows/#overview), and [Caching](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/caching/), to inform me about the portions of the code used.<br/>

- When a CI build is successful, what does that philosophically and practically/precisely indicate about the build?<br/>

When a build is successful, that means that there were no errors when CircleCI was following the instructions specified in the .yaml file. The environment was spun, the workflows were executed, and the jobs were completed.

- If you were to take the next step and ready this project for Continuous Delivery, what additional changes might you make in this configuration (conceptual, not code)?<br/>

If this project were to move into Continuous Delivery, I'd add Rollbar to track errors after deployment and identify which code changes caused those errors.
(I used [this blog](https://circleci.com/blog/tracking-errors-after-deployments-with-rollbar-and-circleci/) and [that blog](https://circleci.com/blog/persisting-data-in-workflows-when-to-use-caching-artifacts-and-workspaces/) from CircleCI to help me brainstorm.)

# Step 6: Submitting a Pull Request
_Remember to reference at least one other student in the PR content via their GitHub handle._

# Step 7: [EXTRA CREDIT] Augment the core project
PR reference in the report to one of the following:
1. Add one or more unit tests to the core assignment project. 
2. Configure the CircleCI config.yml to automatically build a Docker image of the project.
3. Configure an automatic deployment of the successful CircleCI build to an Amazon EC2 instance.
