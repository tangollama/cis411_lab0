# Step 4: Setup a Continuous Integration configuration
- What is the .circleci/config.yml doing?
- What do the various sections on the config file do?
- When a CI build is successful, what does that philosophically and practically/precisely indicate about the build?
- If you were to take the next step and ready this project for Continuous Delivery, what additional changes might you make in this configuration (conceptual, not code)?

# Step 5: Merging the feature branch
* The output of my git commit log
* A screenshot of the _Jobs_ list in CircleCI

# Step 6: Submitting a Pull Request
_Remember to reference at least one other student in the PR content via their GitHub handle._

# Step 7: [EXTRA CREDIT] Augment the core project
PR reference in the report to one of the following:
1. Add one or more unit tests to the core assignment project. 
2. Configure the CircleCI config.yml to automatically build a Docker image of the project.
3. Configure an automatic deployment of the successful CircleCI build to an Amazon EC2 instance.
