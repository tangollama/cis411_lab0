# Lab Report Template for CIS411_Lab0
Course: Messiah College CIS 411, Fall 2018<br/>
Instructors: [Joel Worrall](https://github.com/tangollama) & [Trevor Bunch](https://github.com/trevordbunch)<br/>
Name: Matthew Laven<br/>
GitHub: [ml1402](https://github.com/YOUR_HANDLE)<br/>

# Step 1: Fork this repository
- The URL of my forked repository: 
[My Link](https://github.com/ml1402/cis411_lab0)
- The accompanying diagram of what my fork precisely and conceptually represents
- A fork of a project is a seperate entity than the original project itself, giving the new developer full control over the fork. A branch is just a temporary fork that is meant to be re-implemented into the original codebase once modifications are done.

# Step 2: Clone your forked repository from the command line
- My GraphQL response from adding myself as an account on the test project
```
{
  "data": {
    "mutateAccount": {
      "id": "b45db004-59da-45f9-8693-97f862f0dc7e",
      "name": "Matt Laven",
      "email": "ml1402@messiah.edu"
    }
  }
}

```

# Step 3: Creating a feature branch
- The output of my git commit log

# Step 4: Setup a Continuous Integration configuration
## What CircleCI is doing:
```
CircleCI is a continuous integration tool that checks any updates to the code for errors before it allows a commit. 
1. The config.yml file tells CircleCI how to process the code and what version of the program to use. 
2. The first part of the code specifies what build version of CircleCI to use when testing the code. The second part tells where the files are located for CircleCI and the program to be tested. The last part tells CircleCI which type of test to run on the code. 
3. When a CircleCI run is successful, it measn that the code will compile and publish without errors. It means the build is stable, but it does not mean that the code will always perform exactly how the programmer intends it to in terms of features. 
4. I would add some code that would check if CircleCI was sucessful, and if it was, it would auto-commit and push changes to Github to prevent files from not being committed properly. 
```
- What is the .circleci/config.yml doing?
- What do the various sections on the config file do?
- When a CI build is successful, what does that philosophically and practically/precisely indicate about the build?
- If you were to take the next step and ready this project for Continuous Delivery, what additional changes might you make in this configuration (conceptual, not code)?

# Step 5: Merging the feature branch
