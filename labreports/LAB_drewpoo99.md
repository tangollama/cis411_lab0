# Step 4: Setup a Continuous Integration configuration
- What is the .circleci/config.yml doing?
   According to  the CircleCi documentation at <https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/config-intro/#section=configuration>, the config.yml is how CircleCI can interact with code and create builds from it. The config.yml included in this project is the basic config template for a node app. It does a view commands like checkout to get the branch code, then it does the npm install to install node dependencies and then does npm test to run node tests.
- What do the various sections on the config file do?
  * The `version` is the version if the CircleCi platform getting used. In this case it's 2.1.

  * The `orbs` referes to orb references in the circleci namespace named node.

  * The `jobs` tell what jobs are to be done. This is a `build-and-test` job as apposed to a `build` job. It uses the default node `executor` instead of something like an operating system. The `steps` are the steps of executing the build and test. First it does a github checkout to pull branch code, then it uses `node/with-cache` to run node commands in their own `steps`. This one npm installs and npm tests. 

  * The `workflows` are used for orchestrating all jobs. Since there is only one job, the workflow only executes the `build-and-test` job. 

- When a CI build is successful, what does that philosophically and practically/precisely indicate about the build?
  When a CI build is successful, it means that the newest code was run in a `job` and that it has passed any `steps` or tests set up to inspect the code. This means that the most recent push of code is able to be integrated into a master branch and all of the features checkout, there are no errors in the code or in the repository.
- If you were to take the next step and ready this project for Continuous Delivery, what additional changes might you make in this configuration (conceptual, not code)?
  As an example, if we were to deploy to Heroku (*foreshadowing!*), we would add the Heroku `orb`. We can then use a `workflow` to deploy using that Heroku `orb` after some other `jobs` were completed. I assume an `orb` is like a API endpoint sort of thing and CircleCI uses them to do a bunch of stuff behind the scenes for us. (Like deploying to Heroku when we use the orb).

# Step 6: Submitting a Pull Request
_Remember to reference at least one other student in the PR content via their GitHub handle._

# Step 7: [EXTRA CREDIT] Augment the core project
PR reference in the report to one of the following:
1. Add one or more unit tests to the core assignment project. 
2. Configure the CircleCI config.yml to automatically build a Docker image of the project.
3. Configure an automatic deployment of the successful CircleCI build to an Amazon EC2 instance.
