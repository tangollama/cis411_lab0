# Step 2: Clone your forked repository from the command line  
- My local file directory is Desktop/cis411_lab1_CI
- The command to navigate to the directory when I open up the command line is cd cis411_lab1_CI

# Step 3: Run the application locally
- My GraphQL response from adding myself as an account on the test project

# Step 5: Setup a Continuous Integration configuration
```
# Javascript Node CircleCI 2.0 configuration file
#
# Check https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/language-javascript/ for more details
#
version: 2
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      # specify the version you desire here
      - image: circleci/node:10.3
      
      # Specify service dependencies here if necessary
      # CircleCI maintains a library of pre-built images
      # documented at https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/circleci-images/
      # - image: circleci/mongo:3.4.4

    working_directory: ~/repo

    steps:
      - checkout

      # Download and cache dependencies
      - restore_cache:
          keys:
          - v1-dependencies-{{ checksum "package.json" }}
          # fallback to using the latest cache if no exact match is found
          - v1-dependencies-

      - run: yarn install

      - save_cache:
          paths:
            - node_modules
          key: v1-dependencies-{{ checksum "package.json" }}
        
      # run tests!
      - run: yarn test
```

- What is the .circleci/config.yml doing?  
    - config.yml identifies which software it has to install (like yarn) and the type of vitual machine being used. 

- What do the various sections on the config file do?  
    - The "docker" section shows which version of node we are using (node:10.3) 
    - The "working_directory" section shows which repo circleci should work on, in this case, the directory located one step back in the tree.  
    - The "steps" section is broken up into a few small sections. In summary, these sections are used to determine which software to install, in this case, yarn. 

- When a CI build is successful, what does that philosophically and practically/precisely indicate about the build?  
  - When a CI build is successful, that means that the code runs correctly and is compatible with the current build. The code is secure and can be safely deployed without breaking anything. 
   

- If you were to take the next step and ready this project for Continuous Delivery, what additional changes might you make in this configuration (conceptual, not code)?  
  - There would need to be a part in the config file that deploys the updated code to the original repo or branch after it's been successfully built.
