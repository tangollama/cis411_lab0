# Step 4: Setup a Continuous Integration configuration
- What is the .circleci/config.yml doing?

config.yml is specifying what the continuous environment should do.

It is markup to set up the Continuous Integration environment by using a prebuilt image, setting the working directory, Downloading and caching dependencies, and running yarn tests.

- What do the various sections on the config file do?

See answer above.

- When a CI build is successful, what does that philosophically and practically/precisely indicate about the build?

The code passes all written tests/ the new commit doesn't regress in the testing process.

- If you were to take the next step and ready this project for Continuous Delivery, what additional changes might you make in this configuration (conceptual, not code)?

Issue a pull request into the original code base.

PR reference in the report to one of the following:
1. Add one or more unit tests to the core assignment project.
2. Configure the CircleCI config.yml to automatically build a Docker image of the project.
3. Configure an automatic deployment of the successful CircleCI build to an Amazon EC2 instance.
