# Step 5: Setup a Continuous Integration configuration
1. What is the .circleci/config.yml doing?
   1. The config.yml file created a job for the circleci server to run.


2. What do the various sections on the config file do?
   1. 'version:' Names the version of CircleCI pipeline process engine.
   2. 'jobs:' Define a job to be invoked later in a workflow.
      3. 'say-hello:' Is the first (and only) job created.
      4. 'docker:' Specifies the execution environment. You can specify an image from Dockerhub or use one of our Convenience Images from CircleCI's Developer Hub
   5. 'steps:' Adds steps to the job.
      6. 'run:' Lists the functions to be run in the job.
         7. 'name:' Names the function.
         8. 'command:' When run, will print text in the output of a job.
   9. 'workflows:' Define a workflow to invoke a job.
      10. 'say-hello-workflow:' A new workflow.
          11. 'jobs:' Lists the jobs to be invoked by the workflow.


3. When a CI build is successful, what does that philosophically and practically/precisely indicate about the build?  
   1. When the CI build successfully completes that practically allow code is executable-able, philosophically this means that you have reached the next step towards reaching your end goal.


4. If you were to take the next step and ready this project for Continuous Delivery, what additional changes might you make in this configuration (conceptual, not code)?
   1. If this project was prepared for Continuous Delivery, I would add a patch notes / version tracker section to document and account for the continuous nature for Continuous Delivery.

# Step 7: Submitting a Pull Request
_Remember to reference at least one other student in the PR content via their GitHub handle._


# Step 8: [EXTRA CREDIT] Augment the core project
PR reference in the report to one of the following:

1. Add one or more unit tests to the core assignment project. 

   - With help from ChatGPT and Ray Truex (rt1252) I was able to get run more unit tests.

2. Configure the CircleCI config.yml to automatically build a Docker image of the project.

   - I attempted this aspect of the assignment many times, but found my understanding of docker and CircleCI to not be adequate. I am unsure if partial credit is something you would consider appropriate; because of the time and effort spent on this aspect I would be remiss not to ask. :)

3. Configure an automatic deployment of the successful CircleCI build to an Amazon EC2 instance.
