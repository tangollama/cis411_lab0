# Step 4: Setup a Continuous Integration configuration
- What is the .circleci/config.yml doing?
It connects your git to .circleci so that from your pipline to delpoying, it is completely automated/tested. 

- What do the various sections on the config file do?
It gets your repo, attempt to check it out if it can, runs Yarn (a package manager) in order to reduce errors related to network connectivity

- When a CI build is successful, what does that philosophically and practically/precisely indicate about the build?
It indicates that it is able to provide rapid feedback so that if a defect is introduced into the code base, it can be identified and corrected as soon as possible. This allows for easier deployment and is much easier to manage. 

- If you were to take the next step and ready this project for Continuous Delivery, what additional changes might you make in this configuration (conceptual, not code)?
I'd work on altering the various tests in the build for whatever I need to see or do in the test settings

# Step 5: Merging the feature branch

```
