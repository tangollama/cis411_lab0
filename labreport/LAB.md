--
sets up your repository so that circleci can be used during builds and test. 
--
-   What is the .circleci/config.yml doing?  
      it configures your repository for the circleci infrastracture and it allows for testing builds on a separate branch.

-   What do the various sections on the config file do?
  1. version
    * version of the CircleCI platform you are using and used to detect deprecation or breaking changes.
  2. jobs
    *  Specifies the jobs to be run when code is pushed e.g **builds** as required by circleci since its the only job used.
  3. docker
    * An ordered list of run directives executed in the order declared. 
  4. working_directory
    * The location within the container that the build commands will be run
  5. steps
    * A list of commands needed to build, test, and deploy the project.

-   When a CI build is successful, what does that philosophically and practically/precisely indicate about the build?
* It indicates that the build was successfully merged into the base repository and that the new feature was succesfully integrated without causing issues with the base repository. 

-   If you were to take the next step and ready this project for Continuous Delivery, what additional changes might you make in this configuration (conceptual, not code)?
* Provide environment and set the configuration for deployment
